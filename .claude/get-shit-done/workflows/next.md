<purpose>
Detect current project state and automatically advance to the next logical GSD workflow step.
Reads project state to determine: discuss → plan → execute → verify → complete progression.
</purpose>

<required_reading>
Read all files referenced by the invoking prompt's execution_context before starting.
</required_reading>

<process>

<step name="detect_state">
Read project state to determine current position:

```bash
# Get state snapshot
node "/Users/abiansuarezbrito/Documents/prisma-generate-uml/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" state json 2>/dev/null || echo "{}"
```

Also read:
- `.planning/STATE.md` — current phase, progress, plan counts
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — milestone structure and phase list

Extract:
- `current_phase` — which phase is active
- `plan_of` / `plans_total` — plan execution progress
- `progress` — overall percentage
- `status` — active, paused, etc.

If no `.planning/` directory exists:
```
No GSD project detected. Run `/gsd-new-project` to get started.
```
Exit.
</step>

<step name="safety_gates">
Run hard-stop checks before routing. Exit on first hit unless `--force` was passed.

If `--force` flag was passed, skip all gates and the consecutive guard.
Print a one-line warning: `⚠ --force: skipping safety gates`
Then proceed directly to `determine_next_action`.

**Gate 1: Unresolved checkpoint**
Check if `.planning/.continue-here.md` exists:
```bash
[ -f .planning/.continue-here.md ]
```
If found:
```
⛔ Hard stop: Unresolved checkpoint

`.planning/.continue-here.md` exists — a previous session left
unfinished work that needs manual review before advancing.

Read the file, resolve the issue, then delete it to continue.
Use `--force` to bypass this check.
```
Exit (do not route).

**Gate 2: Error state**
Check if STATE.md contains `status: error` or `status: failed`:
If found:
```
⛔ Hard stop: Project in error state

STATE.md shows status: {status}. Resolve the error before advancing.
Run `/gsd-health` to diagnose, or manually fix STATE.md.
Use `--force` to bypass this check.
```
Exit.

**Gate 3: Unchecked verification**
Check if the current phase has a VERIFICATION.md with any `FAIL` items that don't have overrides:
If found:
```
⛔ Hard stop: Unchecked verification failures

VERIFICATION.md for phase {N} has {count} unresolved FAIL items.
Address the failures or add overrides before advancing to the next phase.
Use `--force` to bypass this check.
```
Exit.

**Consecutive-call guard:**
After passing all gates, check a counter file `.planning/.next-call-count`:
- If file exists and count >= 6: prompt "You've called /gsd-next {N} times consecutively. Continue? [y/N]"
- If user says no, exit
- Increment the counter
- The counter file is deleted by any non-`/gsd-next` command (convention — other workflows don't need to implement this, the note here is sufficient)
</step>

<step name="determine_next_action">
Apply routing rules based on state:

**Route 1: No phases exist yet → discuss**
If ROADMAP has phases but no phase directories exist on disk:
→ Next action: `/gsd-discuss-phase <first-phase>`

**Route 2: Phase exists but has no CONTEXT.md or RESEARCH.md → discuss**
If the current phase directory exists but has neither CONTEXT.md nor RESEARCH.md:
→ Next action: `/gsd-discuss-phase <current-phase>`

**Route 3: Phase has context but no plans → plan**
If the current phase has CONTEXT.md (or RESEARCH.md) but no PLAN.md files:
→ Next action: `/gsd-plan-phase <current-phase>`

**Route 4: Phase has plans but incomplete summaries → execute**
If plans exist but not all have matching summaries:
→ Next action: `/gsd-execute-phase <current-phase>`

**Route 5: All plans have summaries → verify and complete**
If all plans in the current phase have summaries:
→ Next action: `/gsd-verify-work`

**Route 6: Phase complete, next phase exists → advance**
If the current phase is complete and the next phase exists in ROADMAP:
→ Next action: `/gsd-discuss-phase <next-phase>`

**Route 7: All phases complete → complete milestone**
If all phases are complete:
→ Next action: `/gsd-complete-milestone`

**Route 8: Paused → resume**
If STATE.md shows paused_at:
→ Next action: `/gsd-resume-work`
</step>

<step name="show_and_execute">
Display the determination:

```
## GSD Next

**Current:** Phase [N] — [name] | [progress]%
**Status:** [status description]

▶ **Next step:** `/gsd-[command] [args]`
  [One-line explanation of why this is the next step]
```

Then immediately invoke the determined command via SlashCommand.
Do not ask for confirmation — the whole point of `/gsd-next` is zero-friction advancement.
</step>

</process>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] Project state correctly detected
- [ ] Next action correctly determined from routing rules
- [ ] Command invoked immediately without user confirmation
- [ ] Clear status shown before invoking
