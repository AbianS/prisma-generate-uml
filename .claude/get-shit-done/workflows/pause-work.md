<purpose>
Create structured `.planning/HANDOFF.json` and `.continue-here.md` handoff files to preserve complete work state across sessions. The JSON provides machine-readable state for `/gsd-resume-work`; the markdown provides human-readable context.
</purpose>

<required_reading>
Read all files referenced by the invoking prompt's execution_context before starting.

<step name="detect">
## Context Detection

Determine what kind of work is being paused and set the handoff destination accordingly:

```bash
# Check for active phase
phase=$(( ls -lt .planning/phases/*/PLAN.md 2>/dev/null || true ) | head -1 | grep -oP 'phases/\K[^/]+' || true)

# Check for active spike
spike=$(( ls -lt .planning/spikes/*/SPIKE.md .planning/spikes/*/DESIGN.md 2>/dev/null || true ) | head -1 | grep -oP 'spikes/\K[^/]+' || true)

# Check for active deliberation
deliberation=$(ls .planning/deliberations/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1 || true)
```

- **Phase work**: active phase directory → handoff to `.planning/phases/XX-name/.continue-here.md`
- **Spike work**: active spike directory or spike-related files (no active phase) → handoff to `.planning/spikes/SPIKE-NNN/.continue-here.md` (create directory if needed)
- **Deliberation work**: active deliberation file (no phase/spike) → handoff to `.planning/deliberations/.continue-here.md`
- **Research work**: research notes exist but no phase/spike/deliberation → handoff to `.planning/.continue-here.md`
- **Default**: no detectable context → handoff to `.planning/.continue-here.md`, note the ambiguity in `<current_state>`

If phase is detected, proceed with phase handoff path. Otherwise use the first matching non-phase path above.
</step>

<step name="gather">
**Collect complete state for handoff:**

1. **Current position**: Which phase, which plan, which task
2. **Work completed**: What got done this session
3. **Work remaining**: What's left in current plan/phase
4. **Decisions made**: Key decisions and rationale
5. **Blockers/issues**: Anything stuck
6. **Human actions pending**: Things that need manual intervention (MCP setup, API keys, approvals, manual testing)
7. **Background processes**: Any running servers/watchers that were part of the workflow
8. **Files modified**: What's changed but not committed
9. **Blocking constraints**: Anti-patterns or methodological failures encountered during this session that a resuming agent MUST be aware of before proceeding. Only include items discovered through actual failure — not warnings or predictions. Assign each constraint a `severity`:
   - `blocking` — The resuming agent MUST demonstrate understanding before proceeding. The discuss-phase and execute-phase workflows will enforce a mandatory understanding check.
   - `advisory` — Important context but does not gate resumption.

Ask user for clarifications if needed via conversational questions.

**Also inspect SUMMARY.md files for false completions:**
```bash
# Check for placeholder content in existing summaries
grep -l "To be filled\|placeholder\|TBD" .planning/phases/*/*.md 2>/dev/null || true
```
Report any summaries with placeholder content as incomplete items.

<step name="write_structured">

# BLOCKING CONSTRAINTS — Read Before Anything Else

> These are not suggestions. Each constraint below was discovered through failure.
> Acknowledge each one explicitly before proceeding.

- [ ] CONSTRAINT: [name] — [what it is] — [structural mitigation required]

**Do not proceed until all boxes are checked.**

_If no constraints have been identified yet, remove this section._

## Critical Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Severity | Prevention Mechanism |
|---------|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| [pattern name] | [what it is and how it manifested] | blocking | [structural step that prevents recurrence — not acknowledgment] |
| [pattern name] | [what it is and how it manifested] | advisory | [guidance for avoiding it] |

**Severity values:** `blocking` — resuming agent must pass understanding check before proceeding. `advisory` — important context, does not gate resumption.

_Remove rows that do not apply. The discuss-phase and execute-phase workflows parse this table and enforce a mandatory understanding check for any `blocking` rows._

<current_state>
[Where exactly are we? Immediate context]
</current_state>

<completed_work>

Completed Tasks:
- Task 1: [name] - Done
- Task 2: [name] - Done
- Task 3: [name] - In progress, [what's done]
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Task 3: [what's left]
- Task 4: Not started
- Task 5: Not started
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Decided to use [X] because [reason]
- Chose [approach] over [alternative] because [reason]
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- [Blocker 1]: [status/workaround]
</blockers>

## Required Reading (in order)
<!-- List documents the resuming agent must read before acting -->
1. [document] — [why it matters]
1. `.planning/METHODOLOGY.md` (if it exists) — project analytical lenses; apply before any assumption analysis

## Critical Anti-Patterns (do NOT repeat these)
<!-- Mistakes discovered this session that must be structurally avoided -->
- [ANTI-PATTERN]: [what it is] → [structural mitigation]

## Infrastructure State
<!-- Running services, external state, environment specifics -->
- [service/env]: [current state]

## Pre-Execution Critique Required
<!-- Fill in ONLY if pausing between design and execution (e.g. spike design done, not yet run) -->
- Design artifact: [path]
- Critique focus: [key questions the critic should probe]
- Gate: Do NOT begin execution until critique is complete and design is revised

<context>
[Mental state, what were you thinking, the plan]
</context>

<next_action>
Start with: [specific first action when resuming]
</next_action>
```

Be specific enough for a fresh Claude to understand immediately.

Use `current-timestamp` for last_updated field. You can use init todos (which provides timestamps) or call directly:
```bash
timestamp=$(node "/Users/abiansuarezbrito/Documents/prisma-generate-uml/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" current-timestamp full --raw)
```
</step>

<step name="commit">
```bash
node "/Users/abiansuarezbrito/Documents/prisma-generate-uml/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" commit "wip: [context-name] paused at [X]/[Y]" --files [handoff-path] .planning/HANDOFF.json
```
</step>

<step name="confirm">
```
✓ Handoff created:
  - .planning/HANDOFF.json (structured, machine-readable)
  - [handoff-path] (human-readable)

Current state:

- Context: [phase|spike|deliberation|research]
- Location: [XX-name or SPIKE-NNN]
- Task: [X] of [Y]
- Status: [in_progress/blocked]
- Blockers: [count] ({human_actions_pending count} need human action)
- Committed as WIP

To resume: /gsd-resume-work
