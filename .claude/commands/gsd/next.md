<objective>
Detect the current project state and automatically invoke the next logical GSD workflow step.
No arguments needed — reads STATE.md, ROADMAP.md, and phase directories to determine what comes next.

Designed for rapid multi-project workflows where remembering which phase/step you're on is overhead.

Supports `--force` flag to bypass safety gates (checkpoint, error state, verification failures).
